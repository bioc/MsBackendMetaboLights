\title{Utility functions for the MetaboLights repository}
\usage{
mtbls_ftp_path(x = character(), mustWork = TRUE)

mtbls_list_files(x = character(), pattern = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{character(1)} with the ID of the MetaboLights data set (usually
starting with a \emph{MTBLS} followed by a number).}

\item{mustWork}{for \code{mtbls_ftp_path()}: \code{logical(1)} whether the validity of
the path should be verified or not. By default (with \code{mustWork = TRUE})
the function throws an error if either the data set does not exist or
if the folder can not be accessed (e.g. if no internet connection is
available).}

\item{pattern}{for \code{mtbls_list_files()}: \code{character(1)} defining a pattern
to filter the file names, such as \code{pattern = "^a_"} to retrieve the
file names of all assay files of the data set. This parameter is
passed to the \code{\link[=grepl]{grepl()}} function.}

\description{
\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/}{MetaboLights} is one of the main
public repositories for deposition of metabolomics experiments including
(raw) mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR data files and experimental/analysis
results. The experimental metadata and results are stored as plain text
files in ISA-tab format. Each MetaboLights experiment must provide a
file describing the samples analyzed and at least one \emph{assay} file that
links between the experimental samples and the (raw and processed) data
files with quantification of metabolites/features in these samples.

Each experiment in MetaboLights is identified with its unique identifier,
starting with \emph{MTBLS} followed by a number. The data (metadata files and
MS/NMR data files) of an experiment are available through the repository's
ftp server.

The functions listed here allow to query and retrieve information of an
data set/experiment from MetaboLights.
\itemize{
\item \code{mtbls_ftp_path}: returns the FTP path for a provided MetaboLights ID.
With \code{mustWork = TRUE} (the default) the function throws an error if
the path is not accessible (either because the data set does not exist or
no internet connection is available). The function returns a
\code{character(1)} with the FTP path to the data set folder.
\item \code{mtbls_list_files}: returns the available files (and directories) for the
specified MetaboLights data set (i.e. the FTP directory content of the
data set). The function returns a \code{character} vector with the relative
file names to the absolute FTP path (\code{mtbls_ftp_path()}) of the data set.
Parameter \code{pattern} allows to filter which file names should be returned.
}

\examples{

## Get the FTP path to the data set MTBLS2
mtbls_ftp_path("MTBLS2")

## Retrieve available files (and directories) for the data set MTBLS2
mtbls_list_files("MTBLS2")

## Retrieve the available assay files (file names starting with "a_").
afiles <- mtbls_list_files("MTBLS2", pattern = "^a_")
afiles

## Read the content of one file
a <- read.table(paste0(mtbls_ftp_path("MTBLS2"), afiles[1L]),
    header = TRUE, sep = "\t", check.names = FALSE)
head(a)
