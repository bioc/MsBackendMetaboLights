# Retrieve Mass Spectrometry Data from MetaboLights

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This repository provides a *backend* for
[Spectra](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra) objects that
represents and retrieves mass spectrometry (MS) data directly from metabolomics
experiments deposited at the public
[MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) repository. Mass
spectrometry data files of an experiment are downloaded and cached locally using
the [BiocFileCache](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocFileCache) package.


# Installation

The package can be installed with

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("RforMassSpectrometry/MsBackendMetaboLights")
```
