Description: MetaboLights is one of the main public repositories for storage
             of metabolomics experiments, which includes analysis results as
	     well as raw data. The MsBackendMetaboLights package provides
	     functionality to retrieve and represent mass spectrometry (MS)
	     raw data from MetaboLights. Raw data from metabolomics experiments
	     can thus be directly and seamlessly integrated into R-based
	     analysis workflows with the Spectra and MsBackendMetaboLights
	     package.
